description: A network represents a network segment. It can either represent a VLAN
  (then usually ties to a L3 subnet), optionally associate it with a subnet which
  can later be used to create addition routes. Used for ports doing `family ethernet-switching`.
  It can also be a pure L3-subnet that can then be used against a port that with `family
  inet`.
