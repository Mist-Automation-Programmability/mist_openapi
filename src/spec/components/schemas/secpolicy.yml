description: "Security Policy is designed to audit / catch discripancies between \u201C\
  what\u2019s intended to be running\u201D versus \u201Cwhat\u2019s actually running\u201D\
  \ in a network. Many big organizations have separated Security and IT team (for\
  \ good reasons). Each site can be assigned a security policy. Whenever an AP is\
  \ provisioned, the configuration will be checked against the security policy. Any\
  \ violations will be flagged in Device Config History where you can search for the\
  \ when and where the violation occurs."
