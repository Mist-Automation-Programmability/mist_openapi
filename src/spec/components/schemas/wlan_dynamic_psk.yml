description: 'for dynamic PSK where we get per_user PSK from Radius

  dynamic_psk allows PSK to be selected at runtime depending on context (wlan/site/user/...)
  thus following configurations are assumed (currently)

  - PSK will come from RADIUS server

  - AP sends client MAC as username ans password (i.e. `enable_mac_auth` is assumed)

  - AP sends BSSID:SSID as Caller-Station-ID

  - `auth_servers` is required

  - PSK will come from cloud WLC if source is cloud_psks

  - default_psk will be used if cloud WLC is not available

  - `multi_psk_only` and `psk` is ignored

  - `pairwise` can only be wpa2-ccmp (for now, wpa3 support on the roadmap)'
