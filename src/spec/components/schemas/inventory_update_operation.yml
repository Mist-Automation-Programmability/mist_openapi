description: '* if `op`== `upgrade_to_mist`: Upgrade to mist-managed

  * if `op`== `downgrade_to_jsi`: Downgrade to basic monitoring. When downgrading
  a VC member to jsi, we will move the cloud connection of the VC to jsi-terminator
  and keep all VC device/inventories intact for pain-free upgrading back to mist.

  * if `op`== `assign`: Assign inventory to a site

  * if `op`== `unassign`: Unassign inventory from a site

  * if `op`== `delete`: Delete multiple inventory from org. If the device is already
  assigned to a site, it will be unassigned.'
