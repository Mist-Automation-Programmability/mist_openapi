Security Policy is designed to audit / catch discripancies between
"what's intended to be running" versus "what's actually running" in a network. 

Many big organizations have separated Security and IT team (for good reasons). Each site can be assigned a security policy.
 Whenever an AP is provisioned, the configuration will be checked against the security policy.
 Any violations will be flagged in [Device Config History]($e/Sites%20Devices/searchSiteDeviceConfigHistory) where you can search for the when and where the violation occurs.
