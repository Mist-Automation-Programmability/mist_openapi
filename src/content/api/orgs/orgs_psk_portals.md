PSK Self-Service Portals are for
1. **WIFI users** who want to connect to a WLAN with personal PSK, they're told to connect to a URL where they can login (likely through company\u2019s SSO) and get the WIFI Name / Passphrase - required input fields name, email so we can generate PSK
2. **PSK Admins** (they don't have access to normal Network Admin Portal)

When a PSK portal is created, an unique URL will be generated (e.g. https://psk.mist.com/xxxxxx)
