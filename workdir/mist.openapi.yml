- description: "In a typical enterprise, a separate group of people, Installers, are\
    \ responsible for install new devices. May it be a new installation (e.g. new\
    \ stores), a replacement installation (e.g. replacing Cisco APs with Mist APs),\
    \ or addition (e.g. adding new APs for better coverage). Instead of granting them\
    \ Admin/Write privilege, it's more desirable to grant them minimum privileges\
    \ to do the initial provisioning so they cannot read sensible information (e.g.\
    \ PSK of a WLAN), or change configs of running APs.\nAt a high level, Installer\
    \ APs try to achieve the following:\n1. identifying a device by MAC (that\\u2019\\\
    \ns what they see)\n2. they can only touch configurations of the devices they\\\
    u2019\\\nre installing\n3. allow the following configurations: \n  * name * site\
    \ assignment \n  * device profile assignment \n  * map and location (x/y) assignment\
    \ \n  * claim (if not already in the inventory) \n  * replace existing device\
    \ with the device being installed\n\n**Grace Period**\n\nGrace period provides\
    \ a dynamic way to limit what devices / sites installer can work on. Generally\
    \ installers work on recent deployments - bringing up new sites, add newly claimed\
    \ devices to new / existing sites. They make mistakes, too, and may need to further\
    \ tweak some of the parameters. Default grace period is 7 days and can be set\
    \ from 1 day to 365 days."

    \ nacrule, in which case they play the role of classifiers, or they could appear\
    \ in the \u201Capply_tags\u201D section of the of a nacrule, in which case they\
    \ influence the result.\nWhen the \u201Ctype\u201D field of nactag is \u201Cmatch\u201D\
    , it can be used as the classfier of a nacrule.\n- \u201Cmatch\u201D field specifies\
    \ the attribute name and \u201Cvalues\u201D field specifies the list of attribute\
    \ values to match on.\n- When multiple values are specified, its treated as an\
    \ OR condition between those values. This behavior can be changed by setting \u201C\
    match_all\u201D field to \u201Ctrue\u201D, in which case it is treated as an AND\
    \ condition between those values.\n- By default exact match is performed.\n\n\
    This behavior can be changed as follows:\n- Adding `-` at the beginning will perform\
    \ suffix match (ex: -staff will match foo-staff and bar-staff)\n- Adding `-` at\
    \ the end will perform prefix match (ex: foo- will match foo-staff and foo-interns)\n\
    - Adding `!` at both ends will perform substring match (ex: printer will match\
    \ hp-printer-bldg1, brother-printer-lab)\n- Adding `!` at the beginning will perform\
    \ negation of the match (ex: !ssid-guest will match any string that is not ssid-guest)\n\
    - Note: when negation should be used along with suffix/substring operation, !\
    \ should always precede \\* (ex: !guest will match any string that is not ending\
    \ with guest)\n\nWhen the \u201Ctype\u201D field of nactag is NOT \u201Cmatch\u201D\
    , it can be used as the result of a nacrule. \u201Ctype\u201D field identifies\
    \ the action to take and the corresponding field would provide any associated\
    \ parameters to that action. When the \u201Ctype\u201D field of nactag is NOT\
    \ \u201Cmatch\u201D and is any of the result type also supported by usermac table(`vlan`),\

      description: "The VC creation and adding member switch API will update the device\u2019\
        s virtual chassis config which is applied after VC is formed to create JUNOS\
        \ pre-provisioned virtual chassis configuration.\n\n## Change to use preprovisioned\
        \ VC\nTo switch the VC to use preprovisioned VC, enable preprovisioned in\
        \ virtual_chassis config. Both vc_role master and backup will be matched to\
        \ routing-engine role in Junos preprovisioned VC config.\n\nIn this config,\
        \ fpc0 has to be the same as the mac of device_id. Use renumber if you want\
        \ to replace fpc0 which involves device_id change.\n\nNotice: to configure\
        \ preprovisioned VC, every member of the VC must be in the inventory.\n\n\
        ## Add new members\nFor models (e.g. EX4300 and up) having dedicated VC ports,\
        \ it is easier to add new member switches into a VC by just connecting cables\
        \ with the dedicated VC ports. Cloud will detect the new members and update\
        \ the inventory.\n\nFor EX2300 VC, adding new members requires to follow the\
        \ procedures below:\n1. Powering on the new member switches and ensuring cables\
        \ are not connected to any VC ports.\n2. Claim or adopt all new member switches\
        \ under the VC\u2019s organization Inventory\n3. Assign all new member switches\
        \ to the same Site as the VC\n4. Invoke vc command to add switches to the\
        \ VC.\n5. Connect the cables to the VC ports for these switches\n6. After\
        \ a while, the Org\u2019s Inventory shows this new switches has been added\
        \ into the VC.\n\n## Removing member switch\nTo remove a member switch from\
        \ the VC, following the procedures below:\n\n1. Ensuring the VC is connected\
        \ to the cloud first\n2. Unplug the cable from the VC port of the switch\n\
        3. Waiting for the VC state (vc_state) of this switch is changed to not-present\n\
        4. Invoke update_vc with remove to remove this switch from the VC\n5. The\
        \ Org\u2019s Inventory shows the switch is removed.\n\nPlease notice that\
        \ member ID 0 (fpc0) cannot be removed. When a VC has two switches left, unpluging\
        \ the cable may result in the situation that fpc0 becomes a line card (LC).\
        \ When this situation is happened, please re-plug in the cable, wait for both\
        \ switches becoming present (show virtual-chassis) and then removing the cable\
        \ again.\n\n## Renumber a member switch\nWhen a member switch doesn\u2019\
        t work properly and needed to be replaced, the renumber API could be used.\
        \ The following two types of renumber are supported:\n\n1. Replace a non-fpc0\
        \ member switch\n2. Replace fpc0. When fpc0 is relaced, PAPI device config\
        \ and JUNOS config will be both updated.\n\nFor renumber to work, the following\
        \ procedures are needed: \n1. Ensuring the VC is connected to the cloud and\
        \ the state of the member switch to be replaced must be non present. \n2.\
        \ Adding the new member switch to the VC \n3. Waiting for the VC state (vc_state)\
        \ of this VC to be updated to API server \n4. Invoke vc with renumber to replace\
        \ the new member switch from fpc X to\n\n## Perprovision VC members\nBy specifying\
        \ \u201Cpreprovision\u201D op, you can convert the current VC to pre-provisioned\
        \ mode, update VC members as well as specify vc_ports when adding new members\
        \ for device models without dedicated vc ports. Use renumber for fpc0 replacement\
        \ which involves device_id change.\n\nNote: \n1. vc_ports is used for adding\
        \ new members and not needed if * the device model has dedicated vc ports,\
        \ or * no new member is added \n2. New VC members to be added should exist\
        \ in the same Site as the VC\n\nUpdate Device\u2019s VC config can achieve\
        \ similar purpose by directly modifying current virtual_chassis config. However,\
        \ it cannot fulfill requests to enabling vc_ports on new members that are\
        \ yet to belong to current VC."

      description: "While all the `evpn_id` / `downlink_ips` can be specifidd by hand,\
        \ the easiest way is to call the `build_vpn_topology` API, allowing you to\
        \ examine the diff, and update it yourself. You can also simply call it with\
        \ `overwrite=true` which will apply the updates for you.\n\n**Notes:**\n1.\
        \ You can use `core` / `distribution` / `access` to create a CLOS topology\n\
        2. You can also use `core` / `distribution` to form a 2-tier EVPN topology\
        \ where ESI-Lag is configured distribution to connect to access switches\n\
        3. In a small/medium campus, `collapsed-core` can be used where core switches\
        \ are the inter-connected to do EVPN\n4. The API uses a few pre-defined parameters\
        \ and best-practices to generate the configs. It can be customized by using\
        \ `evpn_options` in Site Setting / Network Template. (e.g. a different subnet\
        \ for the underlay)\n\n#### Collapsed Core\nIn a small-medium campus, EVPN\
        \ can also be enabled only at the core switches (up to 4) by assigning all\
        \ participating switches with `collapsed-core role`. When there are more than\
        \ 2 switches, a ring-like topology will be formed.\n\n#### ESI-Lag\nIf the\
        \ access switchess does not have EVPN support, you can take advantage of EVPN\
        \ by setting up ESI-Lag on distribution switches\n\n#### Leaf / Access / Collapsed-Core\n\
        For leaf nodes in a EVPN topology, you\u2019d have to configure the IPs for\
        \ networks that would participate in EVPN. Optionally, VRFs to isolate traffic\
        \ from one tenant verus another"

      description: "The VC creation and adding member switch API will update the device\u2019\
        s virtual chassis config which is applied after VC is formed to create JUNOS\
        \ pre-provisioned virtual chassis configuration.\n\n## Change to use preprovisioned\
        \ VC\nTo switch the VC to use preprovisioned VC, enable preprovisioned in\
        \ virtual_chassis config. Both vc_role master and backup will be matched to\
        \ routing-engine role in Junos preprovisioned VC config.\n\nIn this config,\
        \ fpc0 has to be the same as the mac of device_id. Use renumber if you want\
        \ to replace fpc0 which involves device_id change.\n\nNotice: to configure\
        \ preprovisioned VC, every member of the VC must be in the inventory.\n\n\
        ## Add new members\nFor models (e.g. EX4300 and up) having dedicated VC ports,\
        \ it is easier to add new member switches into a VC by just connecting cables\
        \ with the dedicated VC ports. Cloud will detect the new members and update\
        \ the inventory.\n\nFor EX2300 VC, adding new members requires to follow the\
        \ procedures below:\n1. Powering on the new member switches and ensuring cables\
        \ are not connected to any VC ports.\n2. Claim or adopt all new member switches\
        \ under the VC\u2019s organization Inventory\n3. Assign all new member switches\
        \ to the same Site as the VC\n4. Invoke vc command to add switches to the\
        \ VC.\n5. Connect the cables to the VC ports for these switches\n6. After\
        \ a while, the Org\u2019s Inventory shows this new switches has been added\
        \ into the VC.\n\n## Removing member switch\nTo remove a member switch from\
        \ the VC, following the procedures below:\n\n1. Ensuring the VC is connected\
        \ to the cloud first\n2. Unplug the cable from the VC port of the switch\n\
        3. Waiting for the VC state (vc_state) of this switch is changed to not-present\n\
        4. Invoke update_vc with remove to remove this switch from the VC\n5. The\
        \ Org\u2019s Inventory shows the switch is removed.\n\nPlease notice that\
        \ member ID 0 (fpc0) cannot be removed. When a VC has two switches left, unpluging\
        \ the cable may result in the situation that fpc0 becomes a line card (LC).\
        \ When this situation is happened, please re-plug in the cable, wait for both\
        \ switches becoming present (show virtual-chassis) and then removing the cable\
        \ again.\n\n## Renumber a member switch\nWhen a member switch doesn\u2019\
        t work properly and needed to be replaced, the renumber API could be used.\
        \ The following two types of renumber are supported:\n\n1. Replace a non-fpc0\
        \ member switch\n2. Replace fpc0. When fpc0 is relaced, PAPI device config\
        \ and JUNOS config will be both updated.\n\nFor renumber to work, the following\
        \ procedures are needed: \n1. Ensuring the VC is connected to the cloud and\
        \ the state of the member switch to be replaced must be non present. \n2.\
        \ Adding the new member switch to the VC \n3. Waiting for the VC state (vc_state)\
        \ of this VC to be updated to API server \n4. Invoke vc with renumber to replace\
        \ the new member switch from fpc X to\n\n## Perprovision VC members\nBy specifying\
        \ \u201Cpreprovision\u201D op, you can convert the current VC to pre-provisioned\
        \ mode, update VC members as well as specify vc_ports when adding new members\
        \ for device models without dedicated vc ports. Use renumber for fpc0 replacement\
        \ which involves device_id change.\n\nNote: \n1. vc_ports is used for adding\
        \ new members and not needed if * the device model has dedicated vc ports,\
        \ or * no new member is added \n2. New VC members to be added should exist\
        \ in the same Site as the VC\n\nUpdate Device\u2019s VC config can achieve\
        \ similar purpose by directly modifying current virtual_chassis config. However,\
        \ it cannot fulfill requests to enabling vc_ports on new members that are\
        \ yet to belong to current VC."

      description: "While all the `evpn_id` / `downlink_ips` can be specifidd by hand,\
        \ the easiest way is to call the `build_vpn_topology` API, allowing you to\
        \ examine the diff, and update it yourself. You can also simply call it with\
        \ `overwrite=true` which will apply the updates for you.\n\n**Notes:**\n1.\
        \ You can use `core` / `distribution` / `access` to create a CLOS topology\n\
        2. You can also use `core` / `distribution` to form a 2-tier EVPN topology\
        \ where ESI-Lag is configured distribution to connect to access switches\n\
        3. In a small/medium campus, `collapsed-core` can be used where core switches\
        \ are the inter-connected to do EVPN\n4. The API uses a few pre-defined parameters\
        \ and best-practices to generate the configs. It can be customized by using\
        \ `evpn_options` in Site Setting / Network Template. (e.g. a different subnet\
        \ for the underlay)\n\n#### Collapsed Core\nIn a small-medium campus, EVPN\
        \ can also be enabled only at the core switches (up to 4) by assigning all\
        \ participating switches with `collapsed-core role`. When there are more than\

      description: "Webhook defines a webhook, modeled after [github\u2019s model](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/).\n\
        \nThere is two types of webhooks:\n* webhooks ([examples](https://www.postman.com/juniper-mist/workspace/mist-systems-s-public-workspace/folder/224925-be01e694-7253-4195-8563-78e2a745e114))\n\
        * raw data webhooks ([examples](https://www.postman.com/juniper-mist/workspace/mist-systems-s-public-workspace/folder/224925-e2d5d5f8-4bdb-4efc-93e4-90f4b33d0b2b))\n\
        \n##### Webhooks\nWebhooks can be configured at the org level (subset of topics\
        \ only) and at the site level. It is possible to have multiple topics in the\
        \ same webhook configuration and/or to have multiple webhooks configured at\
        \ the same time.\n\n##### Client Raw Data Webhooks\nRaw data webhooks are\
        \ a special subset of webhooks that provide insight into raw data packets\
        \ emitted by a client, identified by their advertising MAC address (assets,\
        \ discovered ble, connected wifi, unconnected wifi). The data that client\
        \ raw data webhooks encompasses are reporting AP information, RSSI Data, and\
        \ any special packets/telemetry packets that the client may emit. Note that\
        \ client raw webhooks are the raw data coming from the client and do not contain\
        \ the X,Y location data of the client. In order to get the location data for\
        \ a client please see our location webhooks. Clients can be identified uniquely\
        \ across these client raw data topics and location webhook topic using MAC\
        \ address as the Unique identifier (client identifier).\n\n###### Client Raw\
        \ Data Webhooks Topics\nTopics that correspond to client raw data for different\
        \ client types. \n* `asset-raw-rssi` - Raw data from packets emitted by named\
        \ and filtered assets \n* `discovered-raw-rssi` - Raw data from packets emitted\
        \ by passive BLE devices \n* `wifi-conn-raw` - Raw data from packets emitted\
        \ by connected devices \n* `wifi-unconn-raw` - Raw data from packets emitted\
        \ by unconnected devices (passive)\n\n###### Rules for configuring client\
        \ raw data webhooks\n1. Only one instance of a webhook object containing a\
        \ client raw data webhook topic is allowed. (a site level entry will override\
        \ an org level entry for the client raw data webhook topic in question)\n\
        2. Only one client raw data webhook topic is allowed per `http-post` message\
        \ to webhooks api\n"
